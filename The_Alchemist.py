print('''"The wind began to pick up. He knew that wind: people called it the levanter, because on it the Moors had come from
      Levant at the eartern end of the Mediteerranean.
      The levanter increased in intensity. Here I am, between my flock and my treasure, the boy thought.
      He had to choose between something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted to have. 
      There was also the merchant's daughter, but she wasn't as important as his flock. Because she didn't depend
      on him. Maybe she didn't even remember him. He was sure that it made no difference to her on which day
      he appeared: for her, every day was the same, and when each day is the same as the next, it's because
      people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that sun rises.
       I left my father, my mother, and the town castle behind. The have gotten used to my being away, and so have I. 
      The sheep will get used to my not being there, too, the boy thought.
      "''')
